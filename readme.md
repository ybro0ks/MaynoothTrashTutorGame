Project Overview: Maynooth University Trash Tutor Game
The Maynooth University Trash Tutor Game is an educational application designed to teach users the principles of waste disposal in a fun and interactive manner. It is implemented using Processing, a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. This application combines graphical elements, animations, and a series of interactive challenges aimed at promoting sustainable behavior on campus.

Features and Functionality
Initial Setup
Library Import: The application utilizes the GifAnimation library to work with GIF images for dynamic content.
Image Loading: A variety of images are loaded, including logos, maps, and different trash items, which are integral to the visual experience.
Font and Text: Custom fonts and text strings are initialized to create an engaging user interface.
Game Mechanics
Screens and Navigation: The game is structured into multiple screens, including introduction, gameplay levels, failure screens, and a completion screen. Navigation between these screens is controlled via key presses and mouse interactions.

Gameplay Flow:

Introduction Screens: Introduce users to the trash tutor, game objectives, and rules.
Levels: Users are presented with trash items they must drag and drop into the correct bins. Successful sorting advances the player to the next level, while incorrect sorting results in reduced lives.
Life and Score Management: The game tracks lives and scores, updating them based on the user's actions.
Trash Sorting Challenges:

Dynamic Gameplay: Trash items are initialized and set to specific coordinates, where players drag items to designated bins.
Score Tracking: Correct trash sorting increases the score. Incorrect actions decrease the player's lives.
Graphics and Animations: The game uses static images and GIF animations for visual appeal, helping to represent character interactions and feedback during gameplay.

User Interaction
Mouse and Keyboard Input: The game reacts to mouse clicks and dragging, as well as key presses (e.g., pressing 'A' to advance screens), making the gameplay interactive and intuitive.
Dynamic Feedback: Text updates, animations, and changes in visual elements provide feedback to users on their progress and actions.
Educational Aspect
Objective-Based Learning: Through trial and error, users learn correct trash disposal techniques, gaining knowledge about composting, recycling, and electronic waste management.
Iterative Engagement: Allowing repetition with feedback ensures users understand disposal procedures and come away with sustainable practices knowledge.
Conclusion
The Maynooth University Trash Tutor Game provides an engaging and interactive way to educate users about waste disposal. Through its thoughtfully designed levels and responsive feedback systems, it emphasizes sustainability and proper trash management on a virtual campus setting. The integration of graphics, text, and animations makes learning enjoyable and effective.
